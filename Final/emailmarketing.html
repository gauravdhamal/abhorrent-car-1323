        You’ve won a valuable spot in your prospect’s inbox. Then they clicked
        through to your offer (woo hoo!). Now comes the crucial point of
        conversion—the point when websites fall flat.

            <p>
              Sending visitors to a generic, link-filled website after they
              clicked an email for 20% off pumpkin-spiced dog treats muddies the
              message you’ve already sold someone on and risks distracting them
              from what they came for.

              Whether you’re coding yourself or trying to score dev time,
              creating a new website page tailored to each email’s design,
              messaging, and offering is a drain on resources (that could be
              better spent elsewhere).
