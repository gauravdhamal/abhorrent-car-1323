                    <h1>What Is a Landing Page?</h1>
                    <p>In digital marketing, a <strong>landing page</strong> is a standalone web page, created
                        specifically for a marketing
                        or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or
                        ads from Google,
                        Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web.</p>
                    <p>Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage exploration, landing pages are
                        <strong>designed with
                            a single focus or goal</strong>, known as a call to action (or CTA, for short).
                    </p>

                    <p>It’s this <em>focus</em> that makes landing pages the best option for increasing the conversion
                        rates of your
                        marketing campaigns and lowering your cost of acquiring a lead or sale.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="dcolm">
                <p>Here’s where landing pages might fit into your marketing funnel:</p>
            </div>
            <!-- p tag ending -->
            <!-- img tag starting -->
            <div class="dcolm">

            </div>
            <!-- img tag ending -->
            <!-- p tag start  -->
            <p>As you can see, the landing page exists after prospects at the top of the funnel click a link in an ad,
                email, or
                anywhere else on the web. It’s where the conversion (like a purchase, signup, or registration) will take
                place.</p>
            <p>Q. Wait, can’t any page be a landing page?</p>
            <p>Technically, sure. The term is used this way in Google Ads and Analytics, for instance. But not all
                destination pages
                are made equal. At Unbounce, we use the term “landing page” to describe</p>
            <h2>The Key Difference Between a Homepage and a Landing Page<br>(or Why Landing Pages Are So Freakin’ Good
                at
                Converting)</h2>
            <p>Below we’ve got a homepage and a landing page laid out side by side. See how the homepage has <em>tons of
                    links</em>
                and the landing page has only <em>one</em>? That’s pretty typical.</p>

            <!-- p tag endig -->
            <!-- img tag starting -->
            <div class="dcolm">
                <img src="https://unbounce.com/photos/1.4_Comparelp_homepage-scaled-1.webp" alt="">

            <!-- img tag ending -->
            <!-- p tag starting -->
            <p>While the homepage has dozens of potential distractions—you can basically call ’em “leaks” instead of
                links—the
                landing page is super focused. Having <strong>fewer links on your landing page increases
                    conversions</strong>, as
                there are fewer tantalizing clickables that’ll carry visitors away from the call to action. That’s why
                expert
                marketers always use a dedicated landing page as the destination of their traffic.</p>
            <p>Sure, the homepage looks amazing. It shows off the brand, lets people explore a range of products, and
                offers
                additional info about the company and its values. From here, a visitor can go anywhere—apply for a job,
                read some
                press releases, review the terms of service, post on the community boards, etc.</p>
            <p>But they won’t necessarily make a purchase. And that’s the point.</p>
            <p>The landing page for this customer serves a completely different purpose. Paired with super slick ads
                that promote a
                single offer, everything about it works hard to turn these visitors into <em>customers</em>. It’s doing
                a better job
                to convert the traffic the brand’s already getting. That’s the power of landing pages!</p>

            <h3>Q. Why not just pay to increase my traffic?</h3>
            <p>Running ads or email campaigns gets costly and search engine optimization can take a very long time. By
                using landing
                pages, you’ll <strong>convert more of your existing visitors</strong> and stretch those all-important
                resources
                (money and time, we mean) further.</p>
            <h2>Types of Landing Pages</h2>
            <p>You’ll see a lot of variation out there, depending on the specifics of the business, but there are really
                two
                archetypal landing page (defined by their goals):</p>
            <!-- p tag starting -->
            <!-- img tage starting  -->
            <div class="dcolm">

            </div>
            <!-- img tag endig -->

            <!-- p tag starting  -->
            <p><strong>Lead Generation Landing Pages:</strong> Also called “lead gen” or “lead capture” pages, these use
                a form as
                their call to action. This form almost always collects lead data, like the names and email addresses of
                visitors.
                (You can read some <a
                    href="#"
                    target="_blank">expert-certified lead gen strategies here</a>.)</p>
            <p>B2B marketers and companies selling high-ticket items use this type of landing page to build a list of
                prospective
                customers. They sometimes offering something free, like an ebook or webinar, in exchange for contact
                info. Ecommerce
                brands can also use these pages for list-building, or offering free shipping or special deals, too.</p>

            <p><strong>Clickthrough Landing Pages:</strong> Frequently used by ecommerce and SaaS
                (software-as-a-service) marketers,
                clickthrough pages go straight for sales or subscription. Usually, they have a simple button as the call
                to action
                that sends the visitor into the checkout flow (like <a
                    href="#" target="_blank">the app
                    store</a>) or
                completes a transaction.</p>
            <h2>Driving Traffic to Landing Pages</h2>
            <p>You’re going to need to fill that funnel full of visitors for your landing page to work. Fortunately,
                you’ve got a
                lot of options. Let’s explore some of the more common sources of traffic to landing pages.</p>
            <h3>Paid Search Traffic</h3>
            <p>Most search engines include paid advertising. When someone looks something up (say, “cheese of the month
                club”) these
                ads appear clearly marked—but not too clearly marked—in the search results. Here’s a typical example
                from Google:
            </p>
            <!-- p tag ending -->
            <!-- img tag starting  -->
            <div class="dcolm">
                <img src="https://unbounce.com/photos/1.3_GoogleAd-scaled-1.webp" alt="">
            </div>
            <!-- img tag ending -->
            <p>Unlike the other results on the page, <strong>pay-per-click ads</strong> are prepared and paid for by
                marketers.
                Someone who clicks will be primed by your charming copy (and, sometimes, your visuals). And you’ve
                likely targeted
                them based on their search term, demographic data, or interests revealed by their browsing history.</p>

            <p>Crucially, when you create an ad, you get to choose where the link takes your visitor. Yes, you could
                choose to send
                them to your homepage. But, as we’ll explore below, it’s much better to create a standalone landing page
                that
                <strong>matches your ad copy and offers a clear call to action</strong>.
            </p>
            <h3>Paid Social Traffic</h3>
            <p>Running ads on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn is a kickass way to
                target people
                and communities who’ll be particularly interested in your brand, regardless of whether they’re in the
                market yet.
            </p>
            <p>Instead of people searching for “cheese of the month club,” you might advertise to people who’ve added
                “cheese
                appreciation” to their list of interests in their Facebook profile. The beauty of it is that you can
                <strong>connect
                    with customers before they start to look for your product</strong>—or before they want it!
            </p>
            <p>Aside from offering advanced targeting features, each social channel has its own characteristics.
                Instagram, for
                example, works well for products and lifestyle brands with a strong visual appeal. On the other hand,
                B2B
                advertisers prefer to use LinkedIn to reach professionals working in specific industries.</p>
            <h3>Email Campaigns</h3>

            <p>Email is often touted as the most effective marketing channel out there because of its <strong>enormous
                    reach (and
                    low costs)</strong> compared to other platforms. A <a target="_blank"
                    href="#">2018
                    study by the Radicati Group</a> projects that there’ll be 4.2 billion email users by 2022. That’s
                more than half
                the planet!</p>
            <p>A powerful combo of emails and landing pages can be used both to nurture existing relationships with
                customers and to
                acquire new ones. After building a list of contacts, your carefully crafted email lets you entice
                readers with your
                offer, while the landing page fills in the details and directs visitors toward a call to action.</p>

            <h3>Organic Search Traffic</h3>
            <p>The term “organic traffic” refers to any visitors who come from an unpaid source—like the bottom half of
                Google or
                Bing search results (SERPs). By creating compelling, legitimately useful content on your website or
                landing pages,
                you can ensure that your business appears more frequently in related searches. The higher your content
                ranks, the
                better.</p>
            <p>Calling it “unpaid” is a little bit misleading, however. It doesn’t mean there isn’t time and money
                invested in
                ranking. (If only!) There’s an entire field of professionals dedicated to squeezing as much organic
                traffic from
                Google as possible through a balance of careful strategy, technical know-how, and brilliant content
                creation. That’s
                search engine optimization (SEO) in a nutshell. (Read more about <a

            <h3>Q. Are there any other channels where landing pages work?</h3>

            <p>It’s impossible to cover every use case we’ve seen. You might run native ads during a podcast, for
                instance, or
                create interactive quizzes, or run traditional print ads with QR codes. No matter how you fill the top
                of your
                funnel, a landing page will help you make the most of it.</p>
