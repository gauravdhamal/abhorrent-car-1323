                    The Digital Landscape Has Never Been More Competitive
                </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="fixp">
                <p>It used to be easier for marketers to stand out online. (Heck, just <em>being online</em> gave you a
                    big advantage
                    over lots of your competitors.) But over the past decade, a wave of martech platforms has
                    democratized the entire
                    digital marketing process.
                </p>
                <p>The result? <strong>Now, everybody is doing the same thing</strong>.</p>
                <p>Your best hope for cutting through the noise is optimization—finding ways to incrementally improve
                    your campaigns and
                    create higher-converting experiences. But for lots of businesses, that’s easier said than done.</p>

                <p>“You should test that” has become one of the most irksome pieces of marketing advice I hear. Testing
                    is great in
                    theory, but unless you’re a large organization with huge traffic, expert knowledge, and some very
                    deep pockets,
                    you’re unlikely to see much success.</p>
                <p><strong>So how can regular marketers get an optimization edge?</strong></p>

                <p>At Unbounce, <strong>we’re championing a new approach called conversion intelligence</strong>, which
                    addresses the
                    challenges of optimization and makes it much easier to increase the conversion rates of your
                    campaigns.</p>
                <p>We used to say that simply having a landing page was enough to give you an edge over your
                    competition, but it’s no
                    longer true—partly because it’s such a widely known best practice.</p>
                <p>Today, what’s giving marketers an advantage is data and automation. <strong>Their advantage is the
                        machine</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>In this step-by-step guide, we’ll show you how conversion intelligence works and explain the ways
                    that it can help
                    you out-optimize the competition.<br></p>

                The internet
                is getting crowded and it’s become increasingly difficult for marketers to reach (and convert) their
                customers.
                Small businesses need a better way to compete—and today, <strong>many recognize that <a

                to optimize their campaigns in real-time—and that means more conversions.</p>

            <p>There are plenty of SMB marketers who are already taking advantage. Daniel Parscale from CD Baby used

            <p>But this is more than a new way of thinking about marketing or adding to expanding your technology stack.
                <strong>Conversion intelligence is an active, iterative process in which the marketer and “the machine”

        <p>The most effective applications of conversion intelligence follow a similar loop: learn, build, and optimize

                <h3>Optimize</h3>
                <p>Work with AI to automatically optimize your content and deliver the most relevant experiences to each

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Imagine you’re launching a campaign to get people signed up for a trial of your software.</p>
        <p>First, you <strong>learn</strong> how to create higher-performing content by researching machine-derived
            insights
            related to your audience. Next, you <strong>build</strong> your campaign assets (like ads and landing pages)
            using
            those insights and often with assistance from the machine itself. Finally, you allow the machine to
            <strong>optimize</strong> your campaign based on incoming data while simultaneously generating new
            insights—allowing
            you to start the process over again.
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s an important point. Conversion intelligence isn’t a process you apply once, or only when you’re first

            <h3>Oli Gardner: "The Champion is a Lie"</h3>
            <p>Hey, it’s Oli again. Throughout this guide, you’ll find some of my additional thoughts in callout boxes
                like this one.
                (Just look for the dark background.)</p>
            <p>
                Until now, the standard practice of marketing optimization was to build and launch your campaign, see
                how it performs,
                do some research and analysis, then come up with a hypothesis for an A/B test. The goal is to find a
                “champion”—the
                highest-converting version of whatever you’re testing, whether it’s an ad, email, or landing page.
            </p>

            <p>
                To me, there are some major problems with this approach.
            </p>
            <div class="boxes">

                <div>
                    <h3>It Takes Way, Way Too Long</h3>
                    <p>Ideally, an A/B test will take about three weeks to complete—but if you’re not getting enough
                        traffic, it could be
                        months, or longer.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>It’s Usually Not Definitive</h3>
                    <p>The most common outcome for an A/B test is a “conversion flatline.” Neither variant proves to be
                        significantly better
                        than the other.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>It Costs You Conversions</h3>
                    <p>Not every visitor is the same. When you choose a champion, you’re losing all of the people who
                        would only convert on the
                        other variant.</p>

                <p>Conversion intelligence (using a tool like Unbounce) solves all of these issues . Rather than waiting
                    for the results of a test, you start with AI-backed insights that help you create optimized
                    campaigns before you even hit publish. You can create as many variants as you like (without
                    obsessing over perfection),
                    then let machine learning algorithms automatically optimize the path to conversion—the way Smart
                    Traffic does. And
                    because you’re not throwing “loser” variants away, you’re never missing an opportunity to get a new
                    customer.</p>

            <p>. It’s not an obscure point lost in a graph or a curious tidbit you can’t do anything with. Insights
                distill complex

                your campaign
                performance.</p>
            <p>Here’s an example: Our data shows us that ecommerce landing pages tend to convert better when they’re
                under 300 words and written at a middle school level (or easier) . If you’re an ecomm marketer, that’s a

            <p><strong>As marketers, it’s important to differentiate insights from best practices</strong>. Best
                practices are
                usually anecdotal, and what works for one person won’t necessarily work for your audience. They also
                reflect a
                particular set of conditions—maybe a casual experiment run years ago. In contrast, insights are informed
                by a
                significant amount of data, identifying recent trends and patterns from real-life campaigns to show

            <p>Insights can come from lots of places—not just Unbounce. For instance, Google Ads automatically supplies

                    target="_blank">insights
                    about relevant search trends</a>, along with recommendations for applying that information to
                optimize your
                campaigns. Insights also don’t necessarily need to be generated with AI. <strong>What matters is that
                    they’re
                    validated by reliable data</strong>.</p>

                pages (less than
                250 words) convert more often, plus your prospects generally respond better to positive language. Hey,
                you can use that.</p>

        <h3>How to Apply Insights</h3>
        <p>When you’re building a new campaign, insights should inform the process right from the start. And not just
            for your
            landing page—for every asset you create.</p>
        <p>Let’s say you’re trying to collect leads for a realty company:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As you start to build your landing page, Unbounce’s <a
                    href="https://unbounce.com/product/smart-builder/">Smart
                    Builder</a> might use sentiment analysis to recommend a different headline.</li>
            <li>You would know from the <a
                    href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report?customer=yes">Conversion
                    Benchmark Report</a> that your page should use fewer form fields and be neutral in tone.</li>
            <li>You would also know that social visitors tend to perform better than search, which might encourage you
                to run
                more Facebook ads.</li>
            <li>Before creating those ads, you could use <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/business/insights/tools/audience-insights" rel="noopener"
                    target="_blank">Facebook Audience Insights</a> to learn more about your ideal customers and further
                tailor
                your messaging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And so on, and so on. In this way, <strong>you can confidently assemble a higher-converting campaign before
                it even
                launches</strong>.</p>
        <p>Applying insights to a campaign in progress isn’t much different—and if you’re working with conversion
            intelligence
            tools, you’ll probably find yourself doing it often. That’s because the machine should be constantly
            processing data
            to identify new opportunities for optimization.</p>

            <h3>Oli Gardner: “Understand the Keys to Conversion”</h3>
            <p>My thought process for landing page optimization has always focused on the intersection of the four keys
                to
                conversion, where copy, design, interaction, and psychology meet to persuade a visitor to act. But based
                on new
                Unbounce research, we now have insights that show we should be optimizing for a <em>fifth key</em>, too:
                the traffic
                factors that shape each visitor’s arrival.</p>

        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="olidiv">
            <p>For copy and psychology, we can optimize the emotion, sentiment, word count, and reading ease of our
                content. Design
                and interaction factors include things like page layout, distraction removal, and how we structure our
                lead gen
                forms. And now for traffic, we can start to consider things like which platforms visitors are arriving
                from.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report?customer=yes">Conversion Benchmark

            <h3>Building with the Machine</h3>
            <p>Marketing AI exists to support and amplify your own capabilities. While you’re building your campaign,
                that
                means a
                conversion intelligence tool should be actively assisting you in creating higher-converting content
                (like <a href="https://unbounce.com/product/smart-builder/">Smart Builder</a> does).</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="conversion">
        <img src="https://unbounce.com/photos/Desktop-Image-Builder-Optimize-Pillar.jpg" alt="">
        <p>However, <strong>it’s important that you also build in a way that maximizes the machine</strong>.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional optimization where you’re trying to find a “champion” version of your campaign,
            <strong>AI-powered
                optimization often means creating multiple conversion paths</strong>, then using the processing power of
            the
            machine to deliver the most relevant experience to each visitor. But in order to do that, marketers need to
            build
            their campaigns a little differently.
        </p>
        <p>Google’s Responsive Ads require that marketers write multiple versions of their headline, description, and so
            on,
            then use machine learning to predict (and assemble) the highest-converting ad for each recipient. Similarly,
            marketers using Unbounce’s <a href="https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/">Smart Traffic</a> need to
            create
            variants of their landing page if they want to use AI to route each visitor to the version that’s best for
            them.</p>
        <p>Generally, you might think of it this way: <strong>You build, the machine optimizes</strong>.</p>
        <p>Every conversion intelligence tool will have different requirements—but to get the best results, ensure
            you’re
            building with the technology in mind.</p>

            <h3>Oli Gardner: “Remix Your Content”</h3>
            <p><strong>Taking full advantage of conversion intelligence tools means changing the way you approach
                    content
                    creation</strong>.</p>
            <p>Take Unbounce. Our <a href="https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/">Smart Traffic</a> feature uses
                AI to
                automatically route your visitors to the landing page variant where they’re most likely to convert. So
                by creating
                several versions of your page before you launch your campaign, you’ll increase your chances of success.
            </p>
            <p>If you’re thinking “jeez Oli, that’s too much work—I just wanna launch,” consider that 1) our customers
                see <strong>an average of 30% lift in conversion rates</strong>, and 2) with the right approach,
                <strong>variant creation is easier than you think</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>To remove some of the complexities associated with variant design, it helps to divide the page into
                <strong>semantic
                    sections</strong>—groupings of page elements that share a related meaning or purpose.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="olidiv">
            <p>A great exercise is to come up with a few versions of each of these sections, which become building
                blocks that you can mix and match to create interesting new variants.</p>
            <p>To illustrate, for the value proposition section we could create three versions based on the insights
                explored in the
                <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-benchmark-report?customer=yes">Conversion Benchmark Report</a>.
                One version
                could have more positive sentiment and another with shorter copy (like a headline, but no subhead). You
                might even
                create a “dark mode” version that might provide a better experience early or late in the day.

        <div class="olidiv">
            <p>Repeat this with the other semantic sections and you’ll quickly have a mini library of assets to combine

            <p>To this point, you’ve been optimizing your campaign manually. It’s time to turn things over to the
                machine.</p>
            <p>Exactly what this looks like will depend on the conversion intelligence tool you’re using. The general
                principle,
                though, is that <strong>AI should be using new data to identify conversion opportunities and help you
                    provide
                    optimized experiences for your audience</strong>.</p>
            <p>Let’s use Unbounce as an example. Once you’ve built multiple variants of your landing page, you can
                launch (or
                relaunch) your campaign using <a href="https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/">Smart Traffic</a>.

            <h3>Oli Gardner: “The Personalization Experiment Failed”</h3>
            <p>In the same way that we’ve heard “it’s the year of mobile” since 200X, marketers and marketing platforms
                have been
                talking about personalization for at least a decade. Yet, we’ve barely moved beyond |FNAME|.</p>

            <p>Smart, talented marketers have been making all the right moves—like creating multiple landing pages for
                their
                campaigns, and targeting them (to increase relevance) to the audiences they <em>thought</em> were the
                best fit. The
                intent is spot on, but it’s really hard to get right, and harder still to scale.</p>
            <p><strong>Conversion intelligence challenges the notion that we need to choose what our audiences
                    want</strong>.
                (Because, frankly, we’re not very good at it.) Technology like <a
                    href="https://unbounce.com/product/smart-traffic/">Smart Traffic</a> alleviates well-intended human
                errors and
                instead uses ongoing data analysis to mathematically predict which content will be most impactful for
                each visitor.
            </p>

            <p>So, |FNAME|, let’s leave this part to the machines.</p>

            <h3>Discover New Insights</h3>
            <p>Automatic optimization is just one way that AI augments your marketing. As data is collected and
                analyzed,
                <strong>the machine should continue to present new insights, enabling you to start the conversion

                targeting that demographic.</p>
            <p>Receiving new insights effectively closes the conversion intelligence loop—but as we’ve stressed
