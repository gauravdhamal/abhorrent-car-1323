        <p>
          If you work in real estate, legal, finance, or the skilled trades—a
          generic website just won’t cut it. Use landing pages to target exact
          keywords, build trust with an on-brand design, and get more leads to
          grow your business.

        Bring in more business by creating client intake and advertising
        experiences that are always relevant. Create landing pages with
        <a href="">conversion intelligence</a> to lower your cost-per-click and

            <p>
              Did you know that “lawyer” is one of the most expensive keywords?
              Don’t lose these pricey clicks by sending potential clients to
              your sprawling website. Instead, use targeted landing pages and
              sign-up forms to schedule consults and jumpstart your intake
              process.

              most of your ad spend by mapping local keywords to simple,
              on-brand landing pages. Win more business by showing clients your
              reviews, qualifications, and contact form all in one spot.

            <p>
              Stop overpaying for expensive real estate ads. Landing pages
              increase your likelihood of engagement, drum up more leads for
              your business, and show off listings in the best possible light.
              So, you can focus on what matters most: closing the deal.
