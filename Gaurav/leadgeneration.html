          wasted ad spend. Unbounce helps capture visitor information through
          easy-to-launch forms for ebooks, webinars, and more—converting more
          visitors into customers, no matter your campaign.

        You can’t fill your funnel with leads if there’s a leak at the top
      </h1>
      <p>
        Any marketer will tell you that leads drop off as they go through the
        funnel—which is why you always need more. Use landing pages and
        <a href="">conversion intelligence</a> to quickly build, optimize, and
        learn from your campaigns so the leads keep flowing.

            <h2>Is your website too overwhelming?</h2>
            <p>
              Your website leaks leads like it’s made of swiss cheese. (Ugh.)
              With so many distractions, visitors are constantly clicking away
              before you get them in your funnel.

            <h2>Are your forms too generic?</h2>
            <p>
              Capturing leads on a website takes a one-size-fits-all approach
              that doesn’t speak to specific visitors, segments, or offers. This
              means you end up with low-quality leads by default.

            <p>
              Active lead gen campaigns require you to move fast as a marketer.
              This can be a challenge when you’re having to go through busy
              developers or designers to build every new page.
