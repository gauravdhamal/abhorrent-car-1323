        <h1>Storefronts are for browsing. Landing pages are for buying.</h1>
        <p>
          Landing page visitors have been shown to convert and spend twice as
          much as those sent to a typical ecommerce store.*
        </p>
        <p>
          With Unbounce, you can quickly create, test, and customize targeted,
          on-brand landing pages that make each product shine and every product
          sell.

      <h1>Landing pages can convert 2x better than online stores</h1>
      <p>
        While your online store is great for high-level information and allowing
        visitors to explore products, ecommerce product pages aren’t up to snuff
        when it comes to making the sale.
      </p>
      <div id="se_main3_div">

          <span class="span1"></span>
          <div>
            <h2>Product pages are generic and lack focus</h2>
            <p>
              No matter how organized your online store is, you’ve still got
              distracting navigation, one-size-fits-all messaging, and competing
              CTAs that can derail a shopper’s purchase momentum. Landing pages
              bring focus to just one conversion goal: sales.

            <h2>Updating your storefront takes too much time</h2>
            <p>
              Time really is money. Tricky website updates and technical
              bottlenecks limit your ability to run promotions and seasonal
              campaigns—so Black Friday could come and go before you even get
              that sale up.

            <h2>Testing ideas for new products is risky</h2>
            <p>
              You need to know whether a new product is worthwhile before
              investing, but even a small change to your live store can take too
              much time. You need a way to experiment outside your storefront.
